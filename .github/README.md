macOS Dotfiles
==============
This repository contains dd's personal dotfiles for
[macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS). This is already a 2nd version
which was "backported" from my [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
[dotfiles](https://github.com/ddnomad/dotfiles.arch). This version uses
[YADM](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) for managing the files under
[VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control).

At any given point in time something in this configuration may be broken either
bacause it was not yet noticed or because there is no time to fix it just yet.

For those curious to see even worse version of these dots there is also
[V1](https://github.com/ddnomad/dotfiles.mac/tree/legacy/v1) branch that keeps
the very first generation of this repository untouched.

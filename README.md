dotfiles.mac
============
This is my WIP configuration for my MacOS machine. Untidy mess it is, I'll
probably will update it quite often. At some point in the future (really
distant future) some cleanup will be done.

TODO
----
* Add install scripts for my favorite linters (look up Neotex configuration for
  that)
* Add skeleton.vim plugin and templates folder
* Integrate tmux into iTerm2
